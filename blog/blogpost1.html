        <p>Building this website has been relatively simple, but as with all things, when you have a blank canvas and the freedom to do what you will, 
        choice paralysis makes it hard to make a decision when there are so many other more lofty ideas.<br><br>
        I first built this basic template on figma to give myself a framework to aim for.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <img class="card-img-top" src="../images/blogtemplate.png" alt="Card image" style="width:50%; height:50%; justify-content: center;">
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Figma template</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="post">
        <div class="text"> 
          <p>Trying to implement and adhere to the framework has gone smoothly so far. After implementing the nav bar i've decided to not include 
          a background color bar for it, my hope is that it can stick to the top as the page scrolls. I've decided to add to the 
          categorisation later when their are more posts and it is relevant. The date of the posts i'm going to manually enter at the moment. 
          Overall I'm happy with the design, I plan to keep it barebones for the moment. Although a subtle amount of color seems necessary. 
          I'd like to add dynamic posting within the website itself in the future rather than manually creating each post.
          I decided I don't need the footer if the navbar is sticking to the top of the screen because it would be redundant.</p>
