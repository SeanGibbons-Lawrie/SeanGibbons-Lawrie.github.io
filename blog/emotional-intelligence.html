          <li>What is Emotional Intelligence?
            <br><br>The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.
                    It's about how you notice your own emotions and feelings, to realise what they mean to you. And realise how they affect you and other people.
                    There are five elements that define Emotional Intelligence: Self-Awareness, Self-Regulation, Motivation, Empathy, and Social Skills.
                    Emotionally intelligent people are masters at managing their emotions. The ability to stay calm and in control in difficult situations is highly valued.
                    Emotional intelligence can be learned and developed.</li><br>
          <li>How is EQ different to IQ?
          <br><br>IQ refers to your intellectual ability. And is about how you logically resolve problems, plan and strategise, understand abstract ideas, learn and adapt to change and grasp and use language.
                    So the main difference between EQ and IQ is that IQ focuses on results and understanding of logical things. While EQ focuses on general awareness and the understanding of emotions and feelings.</li><br>
          <li>Why is EQ important?
          <br><br>EQ helps you to build relationships, reduce team stress, defuse conflict and improve job satisfaction.
                  It is important because it affects the way you interact with others, interacting with others in almost necessary to have a fulfilling life. So the sooner this is improved the easier it becomes to enjoy life in the future.
