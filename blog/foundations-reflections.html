          <li>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
            <br><br>
            - I struggle to put myself or my work in front of the cohort due to some fear of ridicule or shame.<br>
            - I am confident going in to these subjects, but realise it challenges me a lot more than I expected.<br>
            - The neuroplasticity reignited an interest in the neurology
            </li><br>
          <li>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
          <br><br>
            These concepts help to guide you to make sensible decisions and prioritise each step in a logical manner, the empathy is important
            for how you treat your team members and yourself
          </li><br>
          <li>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            <br><br>
            How even though I was aware of some of the concepts, just how effective they are and it's mindblowing they aren't more commonly taught
            especially from a younger age.
          </li><br>
          <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            <br><br>
            Taking the time to really think about the ideas and flesh them out in my own words to further my understanding.
          </li><br>
          <li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            <br><br>
            Due to this being an a tech course, the idea seems to be focus on learning how to learn, so that we are more effective in teaching ourselves
            and can be confident in improving our skills constantly after the course, as the industry demands.
          </li><br>
          <li>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            <br><br>
            It wasn't a waste of time for me, I can see if somebody already had great habits and understanding of the core concepts it would be a little bit wasteful.
            Even in that case a refresher is helpful.
