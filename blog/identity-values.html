        Identity and Values

        <ol>
          <li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
            <br><br></li><br>
          <li>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
            <br><br>As I grew up I noticed the prevalence of lies, whether they be small or big, and also told my own lies. Eventually I grew sick of the knots that lies tie you in, and became honest to a fault, being cruel to be kind has a certain place, but it tends to isolate you. I'm at a more balanced place now of diplomatic honesty, it's an integral part of my character and I'm very grateful for getting to this point. No one is perfect though and small lies find a way of slipping into life.</li><br>
          <li>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
            <br><br>I view my Spirituality as my greatest strength. Having belief in myself and others, believing in myself to be capable of any task with sufficient preparation and learning. Trusting in the goodness I believe is natural in everyone, that we all desire a better outcome for everyone else and would be happy to contribute in others success. Honesty is covered above, and another main one is forgiveness. This ties into my spirituality, in having faith that everyone will learn from their actions and try their best to improve themselves. I think it's important to forgive, the shame and guilt from regretting past actions is very detrimental for someones belief in themself and that belief is the core of life.
            Doing whatever you can to help people move past that and forgive themselves is very admirable. Grudges fester and cause you to think negatively more often and it can affect you mindset/mood severly over time.</li><br>
          <li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            <br><br>My biggest concern for limiting myself over this course and during a career is allowing myself to be distracted and forgetting my motivation for treading this path. If I allow myself to be distracted for short term pleasures of gaming, movies and parties. I run the risk of not making the most out of the course, wasting my own time and money and failing to accomplish what I set out to do, the goals i've made for myself, and slowing down my growth.</li><br>
          <li>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
            <br><br>When working in a burger joint one night the delivery software was set to an earlier time and we were overwhelmed with orders. The general strategy we had every night crumbled a bit,and we ran low on prep. We convened quickly when it happened and had someone get straight on prep while the others tried to keep up. We kept taking walk in orders with a 30min delay We could have contacted the delivery company to coordinate with the customers and spread out the incoming orders.I can't recall if we turned the delivery orders off straight away but that would have let us recover.</li><br>
