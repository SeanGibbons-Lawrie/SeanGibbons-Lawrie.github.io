        Javascript and the DOM

          <li>What is Javascript?
            <br><br>Javascript is akin to a magician's hat. The programmer reaches into the magician's hat, and uses their sleight of hand
                    to produce amazing outcomes. The key here is the ingenuity to come up with the combination of
                    relatively simple concepts like variables loops and arrays. To concieve all the working parts and produce a program.
                    HTML is the brick and mortar of a website, CSS is the furnishings and decorations. Javascript is all the little extra additions to a house that allow
                    the plumbing and electricity to function.
          </li><br>
          <li>Control Flow and Loops
          <br><br>Control flow is basically decision making, based on conditions. If you decide what to have for breakfast it is based on the condition of having the ingredients
                  to make what you feel like. I want toast with peanut butter. I don't have bread. Therefore I cannot make the toast with pb.
                  Loops are generally repeating the same or very similar action while a condition is true or performing x if condition is true and y if the condition is false.
                  When the condition is no longer true the loop is broken.
                  This is like a washing machine, when a 5min spin cycle starts the machine keeps spinning until less than 5mins is no longer true.
          </li><br>
          <li>What is the DOM?
          <br><br>The DOM is the structure of HTML elements in a website. 
                  Everything that makes up your DOM is more generically known as nodes.
                  Nodes can be elements, attributes, text content, comments, doc-related stuff, etc. 
                  All of the HTML elements also have a type, these types extend from the node base that makes up all nodes:
                  Node > Element > HTML Element > assorted types HTMLDivElement, HTMLHeadingElement, etc.
          </li><br>
          <li>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?
          <br><br>The main difference is that arrays have values stored in an index starting from 0.
                  While objects have data stored as a key: value pair. <br>
                  Array data can be accessed by calling the name of the array and the particular index you want to retrieve.
                  Object data can be accessed using dot or bracket notation and not often, object destructuring.                             
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
          <br><br>Functions are commands for a set of actions that you generally need to repeat often.
                  They are useful to avoid repetition in code and increase efficiencey.
