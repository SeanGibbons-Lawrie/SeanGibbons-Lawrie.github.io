          <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?<br><br>My long term goal is to secure a job in the web development/ software development industry.</li><br>
          <li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.<br><br>My greatest strength in regard to learning is my belief in my ability to learn the concepts and understand everything if I put the effort in.
            My greatest weakness is procrastination.</li><br>
          <li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br><br>I would like to see more communication skills developed I tend to be solitary in my work and that will need to change if I want to be an effective team member.</li><br>
          <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.<br><br>
            I once had a solid self learning habit of pomodoro 25 mins 5mins break with a 20min break after 2hours. 
            This is what I will reinstate for the remainder of foundations.
            I think an 8am - 5pm time frame for maintaining this structure is reasonable and will set a good standard going into the bootcamp.
            I'll also have an hour break at 12:20.
            When the pressure is mounting and if I become dispirited I will take a break to do something impactful on restoring my morale. 
            Going to the gym, for a walk, singing, reading a book.
            It's important for me to avoid video games in those moments because I struggle to stop.</li><br>
          <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br><br>If I feel I'm really struggling to learn the content I will first reach out to Michael my facilitator,
            then to my group for advice about how they have understood the content. Both of these methods will be via messaging on discord.
            </li><br>
          <li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team<br><br>I expect some discourse if I have a question about the content, 
            ome suggestions about methods I could use to improve my understanding. 
            And a follow up to said discussion, even if it's just me messaging to thank and say I have understood.</li><br>
          <li>I'll have weekly tennis on Saturday starting in October, and if I am maintaining solid progress I'll likely attend a Tues or Thurs training session also.</li>
