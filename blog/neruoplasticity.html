          <li>What is Neuroplasticity?
            <br><br>
          It is the brain's ability to form connections, when you repeat actions and behaviour, over time these connections become stronger
          and easier to recall and implement. The main reason to build these connections is to encourage positive growth in your mental and physical capacities.
          Generally to improve the efficiency of your learning, your body or support the recovery from mental and physical injury.
          There are some important principles to follow when implementing Neuroplasticity.
          "Use It or Lose It", "Use It and Improve It", "Specificity", "Repetition Matters", "Intensity Matters",
"Time Matters", "Salience Matters", "Age Matters", "Transference or Generalization", "Interference".
            The following website details these principles. <a href="https://www.neuroskills.com/brain-injury/neuroplasticity/ten-principles-of-neuroplasticity/">Neuroplasticity Principles.</a>

          <li>What is a Growth Mindset?
          <br><br>
          A growth mindset is a belief that you can improve anything over time if you persist at learning, even if it feels like you don't have any natural aptitude. 
          It is important to have such beliefs, because they contribute to your confidence and general outlook on life.
          A growth mindset is also a great form of support, when you feel inadequate and like you aren't making any progress 
          it is important to calm yourself and trust that you can achieve the goal in time.
          When combined with neuroplasticity it provides a foundation to learn how to learn.
