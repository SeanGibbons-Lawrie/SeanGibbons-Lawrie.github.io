      Positioning with CSS

            <p>The basics of each positioning type are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Static - this is the default value, all elements are in order as they appear in the document.</li>
              <li>Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position.</li>
              <li>Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.</li>
              <li>Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.</li>
              <li>Sticky - the element is positioned related to the parent element.</li>
            </ul>

                  Works almost the same as static, but it allows you to change the top, left, right and bottom. 
                  So its position is the same as static apart from how you declare it to be altered directionally. 
                  These alterations remove the element from the document flow, it is moved to the specified position, 
                  Not affecting other elements position. The static location is reserved for it however. 
                  In general it is not used for top, left, right and bottom.
                  Instead it's used to contain other positioning elements like absolute.

                Completely removes that object from the document flow and everything else renders as if it doesn't exist.
                Therefore by default it will position itself in the utmost top-left of the page, overlapping other elements.
                It is really useful when you want an element in a specific position and nothing else to move around it.
                Absolute looks for the closest ancestor which is not position default to provide a containing block,
                generally this is what position relative provides.
                Once something becomes position absolute and it finds something that is it's containing block
                it is not looking at the content block anymore it is now looking at the padding block.

          <h1>Position Fixed: </h1>
            <p>
              A position fixed default behaviour always looks at the viewport, so any bottom: 1rem; 
              is always going to be positioned relative to the viewport. It's containing block is the viewport. 
              The problem with position fixed are there are certain situations, if it is placed within a footer for example. 
              It can't look at the viewport, it will be fixed to the footer and can't move outside of it.
              There are some weird edge cases when a parent element has transform, backdrop-filter or perspective 
              the position fixed element can get stuck within that containing block.
              The solution in these cases is to move the position fixed outside of whatever is causing the problem.
              My understanding is that you generally want these elements outside of any parent elements 
              so that they can track on your page relative to the viewport.

        <div class="text"> 
          <h1>Position Sticky: </h1>
            <p>
              When you scroll, a position sticky element should stick in position with it's content block. 
              The containing block doesnt change so you have to be careful if the containing block is very tall, 
              you can check if this is the case by declaring a background colour on the sticky element.
              It's also important that the parent containing block is tall so it has something it can stick inside of. 
              You can add a border on this parent containing block to see how far down the sticky element can go.
