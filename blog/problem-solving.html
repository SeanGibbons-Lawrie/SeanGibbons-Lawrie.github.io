          <li>When I was blocked on a simple problem.
            <br><br>
          I was blocked when trying to figure out the WhereAreYou builtin method.
          My issue wasn't clear to me, I assumed that I wasn't referring to the array correctly
          so I looked up documentation around that. Tried a few alternate methods that all failed.
          Carefully looked through my code with console logs to see where I was going wrong.
          Took a break to try with a fresh head. Frustrated I gave up and moved on.
          It wasn't until I was sent my code to a teacher and he said it should work fine did I try run it again.
          Perhaps I just needed to reset VSCode or my computer, or just run it a second time to confirm.
          </li><br>
          <li>Elegantly solved a problem
          <br><br>
          While doing a Kata on Code Wars I was extremely satisfied to provide a 2 sentence answer
          to a problem. It was take an array of numbers, and sort them into ascending order.
          I had to research the documentation a fair bit, take a few breaks and refactor a couple of parts.
          But I eventually arrived at<br>
          let array = n.toString().split('').sort().reverse().join('')
          return parseInt(array)
          <br>
          Which looks and felt great to get to. There is definitely a way to have a single return line but
          this is close enough for me for now.
          </li><br>
          <li>Pseudocode
            <br><br>
            This is a new habit to me but I can definitely see how useful it
            I'll improve over time but I feel capable of breaking each step down into appropriate sizes.
          </li><br>
          <li>Trying something
            <br><br>
            Always possible to try, generally depends how much I need to google the problem and
            how well I can visualise a solution.
          </li><br>
          <li>Rubber ducky method
            <br><br>
            I haven't given this one a proper chance to be honest. Speaking through the method seems totally viable
            So it's definitely something I need to implement into my habits.
            Kind of funny to imagine this happening en masse in a learning environment.
          </li><br>
          <li>Reading error messages
            <br><br>
            This will come with experience there are a few I am begginning to recognise.
          </li><br>
          <li>Console logging
            <br><br>
            These are super helpful I have had a couple of times when they didn't work
            that was due to me not inputting a defined parameter.
          </li><br>
          <li>Googling
            <br><br>
            I sometimes struggle to find the exact issue I'm struggling with/apply similar solutions to 
            my problem. The documentation like MDN is also still a little difficult for me to understand applications straight away.
            relative to that I'm confident though.
          </li><br>
          <li>Asking your peers for help
            <br><br>
            During foundations I haven't felt that comfortable doing so. Prefering to jump straight to the professional to save time.
            In a campus environment I'm sure the opposite will be true though.
          </li><br>
          <li>Asking coaches for help
            <br><br>
            I have been waiting too long to do so, which partly comes from shame for not keeping up my time investment in the course/myself
          </li><br>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection
            <br><br>
            This has certainly been lacking. Mainly from a refactoring code perspective. I feel I would remember the issues I've dealt with
            much better if I immediately try to refactor it.
